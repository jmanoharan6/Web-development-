                    <p>This site utilizes HTML5: a markup language used for structuring
                        and presenting content on the World Wide Web.HTML5 is the latest specification of the HTML language, and represented a major break with previous markup practices. The purpose of the profound changes to the language was to standardize the many new ways in which developers were using it, as well as to encourage a single set of best practices with regards to web development.</p>
